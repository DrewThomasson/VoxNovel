## üìã Overview

VoxNovel is an innovative program that leverages the capabilities of booknlp to analyze literature, attribute quotations to specific characters, and generate a tailored audiobook where each character has a distinct voice through coqui tts. This not only provides an immersive audiobook experience but also brings each character to life with a unique voice, making the listening experience much more engaging.


### üó£Ô∏è Included TTS Models
All Coqui TTS models-(Tacotron, Tacotron2, Glow-TTS, Speedy-Speech, Align-TTS, FastPitch, FastSpeech, FastSpeech2, SC-GlowTTS, Capacitron, OverFlow, Neural HMM TTS, Delightful TTS, ‚ìçTTS, VITS, üê∏ YourTTS, üê¢ Tortoise, üê∂ Bark), and STYLETTS2.

  - It will update the "Select TTS Model" Dropdown for voice cloning models to also include (List of values to be added).
  - It will update the Dropdown for voices to select for each character to also include (List of values to be added).
- **Make all audio generate with Narrator voice Checkbox:** This will make every character's audio be generated with the voice you have selected for the Narrator when you click the "Generate audio" button.
- **Clone new voice Button:** Click this to add a new voice you can clone (make sure you have a reference audio file on hand).
- **Add Fine-tuned Xtts model to voice actor Button:** If you have a folder containing all the parameters of a fine-tuned Xtts model of a specific voice, then you can click this to make that voice actor clone with that fine-tuned Xtts model, to provide much better voice cloning results.
- **Character voices Dropdowns:** These are the dropdowns for selecting the Voice Actor (and the Accent of each character if using XTTS).
  - (1): The Voice actors available to select from for this character. (Default value is audio selected based on inferred gender of character being: "F, M, Other").
     - When you select a voice It will play the audio sample of that voice, if it's a fast voice model voice and a refrence audio does not exist, then it will generate one to play.
  - (2): The Accents available to select from for this character. (Optional, Default is English).
- **Chapter Delimiter Field:** Will change the default chapter delimiter (The string that's used to identify chapters).
- **Silence Duration in milliseconds (ms) Field:** This will change the amount of milliseconds in between each combined chunk of audio.
- **Select TTS Language Dropdown:** This will let you select the default Accent used for every character which has not had the Accent manually selected for.
- **Loading bar:** Will give an approximate amount of time left. (Estimate, you probably won't see accurate predictions until it's been running for 5 min).
- **Annotated book preview Block:** This will show the entirety of the book with each character's lines color-coded.
  - You can click on a line while the audiobook is being generated to hear what that generated line sounds like. But only if the line has already had audio generated for it; if not, it'll play nothing.
- **Load Book Button:** Clicking this will reload the color-coded annotated book view, it will just randomize the selected colors for each character's lines.
- **Generate Audio Button:** Will start generating the full audiobook.
- **Select random voices Button (Will only be visible if the "include fast Voice Models" checkbox is checked):** Will Select an auto-gender-inferred fast model voice for every character except for the narrator's voice.

## Setting Up GUI Applications with Docker on macOS

This guide provides instructions on how to run a Docker container with a graphical user interface on macOS using XQuartz for X11 forwarding and volume mounting.

### Install XQuartz

1. Download and install XQuartz from [XQuartz website](https://www.xquartz.org/).
2. Open XQuartz.
3. Go to `XQuartz` -> `Preferences`.
4. In the `Security` tab, enable **Allow connections from network clients**.
5. Restart XQuartz to apply these settings.

### Configure and Run the Docker Container

#### Allow Docker to Connect to XQuartz

Open a terminal and run the following command to allow connections from your local machine to XQuartz:

    xhost + $(ifconfig en0 | grep inet | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}')

#### Start the Docker Container

Run the following command to start your Docker container. This command configures the GUI to display on your host and mounts the necessary directories:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/DrewThomasson/VoxNovel.git
docker run -e DISPLAY=$(ifconfig en0 | grep inet | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}'):0 \
           -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
           -v "/Users/$(whoami)/VoxNovel:/VoxNovel" \
           athomasson2/voxnovel:latest
```

### Notes

- **XQuartz Configuration**: Ensure that XQuartz is configured to allow network clients before attempting to connect.
- **Directory Existence**: Verify that the directory `/Users/$(whoami)/VoxNovel` exists on your Mac. If not, create it or adjust the volume mount path in the Docker command as needed.
- **Firewall and Security**: If you face connectivity issues, check any firewall settings and security preferences that might block the connections.

  1. Install VcXsrv:
     ```sh
     choco install vcxsrv
     ```
     - First install VcXsrv and configure it to allow connections.
     
     <details>
       <summary>How to setup VcXsrv</summary>
       
       After installing VcXsrv, it typically launches automatically. You can confirm it's running by checking for its icon in the system tray, usually located near the clock in the taskbar. It may also start automatically when you log in to your system.
       
       To ensure it's configured to allow connections from Docker containers, follow these steps:
       
       1. Right-click on the VcXsrv icon in the system tray.
       2. Select "XLaunch" to open the configuration wizard.
       3. In the configuration wizard, select "Multiple windows" and proceed to the next step.
       4. Choose your preferred settings for display number and screen.
       5. In the "Extra settings" window, make sure to check the box labeled "Disable access control" to allow connections from Docker containers.
       6. Complete the configuration by clicking "Finish" and then "Save configuration" when prompted.
       
       With these settings, VcXsrv should be running and configured to allow connections from Docker containers. You can now proceed with running your Docker commands requiring GUI support.
     </details>
     
  2. Change to your home directory:
     ```sh
     cd $HOME
     ```
  3. Clone the repository:

### Because of BookNLP Windows issues, all of this will be run in WSL (don't worry, it's still easy).
  
## üé• Watch the installation video [here](https://youtu.be/OmJub3uvfz4)

1. In your PowerShell, paste:
   ```sh
   wsl --install
   ```
   to install WSL. (You might be prompted by your system to enable virtualization in your BIOS if it's available, as it is needed to run WSL on Windows.)

2. After setting your username and password, open WSL and paste this command for a single command install:
   ```sh
   yes | wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrewThomasson/VoxNovel/main/shell_install_scripts/Ubuntu-install.sh | bash
   ```

3. **(Optional only for Nvida graphics cards Do not run this command if you don't have a Nvidia graphics card)** Install the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit (required for Nvidia GPU acceleration):
   ```sh
   sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
   ```

4. Make sure you are in the VoxNovel conda environment:(If 'conda: command not found
' IE- conda is not seen as a command then try closing out of the current powershell window and relaunching the wsl env with   [ wsl -d Ubuntu   ]
     ```sh
   conda activate VoxNovel
   ```

5. Navigate to the VoxNovel folder (if not already there):
   ```sh
   cd ~ && cd VoxNovel
   ```

6. Now just run one of the two programs shown below ‚¨áÔ∏è

## üöÄ To Run the program
   ```sh
   python gui_run.py
   ```

## üöÄ Or to run headless
   ```sh
   python headless_voxnovel.py
   ```

## üåê Access WSL Ubuntu Files from Windows

You can access your WSL Ubuntu files directly in Windows File Explorer by entering the following path in the address bar:

```
\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\
```
The output audiobook files will be located under `VoxNovel\output_audiobooks` in the wsl env

## üéØ To Create VoxNovel Windows Desktop Shortcut

Run this command in powershell

```bash
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrewThomasson/VoxNovel/main/shell_install_scripts/Windows-install-scripts/create_desktop_shortcut.ps1").Content
```


### üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation:

To remove everything, run the following command in PowerShell:

```sh
wsl --unregister Ubuntu
```

This will completely remove the Ubuntu environment where the application is stored. üöÆ

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting WSL

If you have trouble with the WSL environment:

1. List all WSL environments:
   ```sh
   wsl --list --verbose
   ```

2. Remove a specific WSL environment (e.g., Ubuntu):
   ```sh
   wsl --unregister <distro_name>
   ```

3. Reinstall WSL:
   ```sh
   wsl --install
   ```

To launch WSL anytime you need to run this program, you can use the search bar in Windows to find and launch "WSL" or run:
   ```sh
   wsl
   ```

<summary> Running with Low VRAM (4 GB) </summary>

### Modifications
- Turns out once you set the device it stays like that for the full program.
- So, I've split the program into two Python programs: one CPU and one GPU. I've tested this on my (4GB VRAM GPU) and this solution works. at least on my end I really hope it works on your end. üôè


### To run the fix I've made tailor made for a low Vram GPU situation:

To run the provided scripts on your system, follow these steps in order:

1. **Book Processing (CPU Only):** 
   - Script: [1CPU_Book_processing.py](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/VoxNovel/blob/main/1CPU_Book_processing.py)
   - This script handles the task of only processing the book using BookNLP, specifically forcing it to run on the CPU.
   - Run with `python 1CPU_Book_processing.py`

2. **Audio Generation (GPU Only):**
   - Script: [2GPU_Audio_generation.py](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/VoxNovel/blob/main/2GPU_Audio_generation.py)
   - This script is dedicated to only generating audio with the GPU and should be run after completing the book processing with `1CPU_Book_processing.py`.
   - Run with `python 2GPU_Audio_generation.py`

### Performance Results

Upon running a mini test with an epub file using the above setup, the following performance metrics were observed:

- **Clone new voice Button:** Click this to add a new voice you can clone (make sure you have a reference audio file on hand).
- **Add Fine-tuned Xtts model to voice actor Button:** If you have a folder containing all the parameters of a fine-tuned Xtts model of a specific voice, then you can click this to make that voice actor clone with that fine-tuned Xtts model, to provide much better voice cloning results.
- **Character voices Dropdowns:** These are the dropdowns for selecting the Voice Actor (and the Accent of each character if using XTTS).
  - (1): The Voice actors available to select from for this character. (Default value is audio selected based on inferred gender of character being: "F, M, Other").
     - When you select a voice It will play the audio sample of that voice, if it's a fast voice model voice and a refrence audio does not exist, then it will generate one to play.
  - (2): The Accents available to select from for this character. (Optional, Default is English).

  - You can click on a line while the audiobook is being generated to hear what that generated line sounds like. But only if the line has already had audio generated for it; if not, it'll play nothing.

- **Generate Audio Button:** Will start generating the full audiobook.
- **Select random voices Button (Will only be visible if the "include fast Voice Models" checkbox is checked):** Will Select an auto-gender-inferred fast model voice for every character except for the narrator's voice.
